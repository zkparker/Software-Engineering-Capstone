							El Espada <br>Food Ordering System
						</h2>
						<p class="mbr-text text-center">
							The El Espada food ordering system was created for the Software
							Engineering Capstone at UIS from students; Avinash Moram, Daniel
							Henderson, and Zach Parker. The system utilizes Spring Boot, JPA 
							with Hibernate, Tomcat, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf, Maven, H2, CSS, 
							and HTML. The purpose of this project is to create a system 
							ready to take online orders	for a Mexican restaurant.<br> <br> 
							<strong>Note that this application is best used in Google Chrome. 
							Most functionality will work in other browsers, but only Chrome is
							fully supported.</strong> <br> We are still working on making this 
							application	available as an app in Apple Store and Google Play..
